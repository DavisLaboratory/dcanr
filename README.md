# dcanr: Differential co-expression/association network analysis

Application and evaluation of methods to infer differential co-expression/associations.
An evaluation framework for testing differential co-expression methods in
R. Simulated expression data with differential associations is used to assess inference methods.
The package provides methods to evaluate inference methods and visualise predictions. Inference
methods without implementations have been added to the package along with interfaces
to existing implementations to enable ease of application and evaluations.

`dcanr` can be installed using devtools:

```r
devtools::install_github('DavisLaboratory/dcanr.git')
```
